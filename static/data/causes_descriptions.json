    {"cause" : "Animal Welfare", "text" : "If you want to reduce the suffering in the world (regardless of who is experiencing it), 
    animal advocacy might be the right cause for you. Over one million land animals are slaughtered  every hour in the US alone. 
    We think improving animal welfare is a high-priority cause area because of its massive scale. 
    Right now there are around 31 billion land animals being raised in factory farms so they can be slaughtered for food. 
    These animals often experience intense suffering throughout their lives. Animal advocacy is an extremely neglected cause area. 
    In the US, only about 3% of charitable contributions support animals and the environment, combined. Of that amount, only about 2% goes to farmed animals."},

    supporting global health and development is a pressing matter. There are millions of people 
    in low-income countries whose lives could be improved (and even saved, in some cases)

Most of the work in this area involves preventing global catastrophes such as climate change, pandemics, artificial intelligence, nuclear war and making our world more resilient.
